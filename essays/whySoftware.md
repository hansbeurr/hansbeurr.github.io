Software engineering for is about more than just making sure a button works or a page loads fast; it's about building things that stay strong when people try to break them. My interest in software engineering starts with the idea that security should be a part of the code from the very first day. Instead of writing a program and then trying to "fix" the security later, I want to learn how to design systems where safety is built into the foundation. This means looking closely at how information moves through a program and making sure there are no hidden doors or weak spots that a threat actor could use to cause trouble.

A big part of what I want to do involves network security. Even the best software can be at risk if the channels it uses to send data aren't safe. I am really interested in learning how to build apps that understand the networks they live on. I want to develop the skills to create programs that can tell when something feels "off" on a network such as when a user is trying to access things they shouldn't or if data is being sent to a strange place. By understanding the rules of how computers talk to each other, I can write code that acts like a guard, protecting the data as it travels from one place to another.

To be a great builder, I firmly believe you also have to know how to be a "breaker." This is where my interest in offensive security comes in. I want to get better at finding weak points in software before others do, by learning how to use testing tools and writing my own scripts to search for bugs, I can see exactly where a program might fail. It’s like a feedback loop: every time I learn a new way to bypass a security wall, I learn exactly how to build a better one in its place. This "threat actor mindset" helps me write much cleaner and more reliable code because I’m always thinking about the "what ifs."


As I look ahead, I want to focus on how to keep software safe even when it gets very large and complex. Modern apps today don't typically sit on one computer anymore rather, they live in the "cloud" and are spread across many different servers, for that I hope to gain experience in cloud security and "container" technology. My goal is to become the kind of engineer who can build entire digital ecosystems that are easy to use but incredibly hard to crack, making the internet a slightly safer place for everyone.
